        <li><h2>Ingrediants</h2></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 pound paneer, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium jalapeño peppers, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cashews</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 pint half-and-half</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><h2>Steps</h2></li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add paneer cubes; cook and stir until golden, about 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Add finely chopped onions, bell peppers, and jalapeños to the pan along with ground cashews, garlic paste, and ginger paste. Sprinkle in cayenne pepper, cumin, coriander, and garam masala. Cook while stirring continuously, allowing the spices to bloom and the mixture to become aromatic and well blended. Sauté for about one minute, until the onions soften slightly and the flavors begin to meld together evenly.</li>
        <li>Mix the tomato sauce, half-and-half, and salt into the paneer mixture, stirring gently to combine all the ingredients evenly. Bring the mixture to a slow, steady simmer, ensuring it does not boil rapidly. Allow it to cook for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens to a rich, creamy consistency and the flavors meld together, coating the paneer evenly and developing a smooth, well-balanced taste.</li>
        <li>Serve it with hot steaming rice. Enjoy the meal</li>
